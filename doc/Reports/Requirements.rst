Requirements Reports

      When a test case tracks requirements, ``EndOfTestReports`` writes them into :file:`<TestCase>_req.yml`. The
      scripts merge and report them automatically:

      * At the end of each test suite, the requirements of its test cases are merged
        (:ref:`RUFF/osvvm/MergeRequirements`) into :file:`reports/<BuildName>/<TestSuite>_req.yml`, and
        :ref:`RUFF/osvvm/Requirements2Html` writes the HTML report next to it.
      * At the end of the build, the requirements of all test suites are merged into
        :file:`reports/<BuildName>_req.yml`, with an HTML (:ref:`RUFF/osvvm/Requirements2Html`) and a CSV
        (:ref:`RUFF/osvvm/Requirements2Csv`) report.

      Without requirements in a build, no requirements report is created.

      :ref:`RUFF/osvvm/SetRequirementUseSumOfGoals`
         How the goals of a requirement in several test cases combine: their sum, or - by default - their maximum.

      :ref:`RUFF/osvvm/SetRequirementTestCaseFailsIfLessThanGoal`
         Whether a test case that doesn't reach a requirement's goal fails. Default: ``true``.

      :ref:`RUFF/osvvm/SetRequirementDoesNotExceedGoal`
         Whether the passed count of a requirement is limited to its goal. Default: ``true``.

      :ref:`RUFF/osvvm/SetRequirementCsvPrintStatus`
         Whether the CSV report has a status column. Default: ``false``.

.. _RPT/REQ/Specification:

Requirements Specification
**************************

.. grid:: 2

   .. grid-item::
      :columns: 6

      A requirements specification lists the requirements and their goals, including those no test case checks yet.
      :ref:`RUFF/osvvm/RequirementsCsv2Yaml` converts a specification in CSV into a requirements YAML file: each
      requirement gets an entry marked as coming from the specification, so it shows up in the reports even without a
      test case. The columns are ``Requirement``, ``Description``, ``Status``, ``Goal``, ``Passed``, ``Errors`` and
      ``Checked``; missing ones get defaults.

      In VHDL, ``ReadSpecification`` reads a specification into the test case.
