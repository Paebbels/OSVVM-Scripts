      YAML files are the data the reports are created from. OSVVM's utility library writes the results of a test case
      from VHDL; OSVVM-Scripts writes what it knows about the build. The HTML and XML reports are created from these
      files, so they can be :ref:`created again <RPT/Errors>` at any time.

      The formats are described in :ref:`YAML`.
